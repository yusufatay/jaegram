# Instagram Points Application - Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to address the issues in the Instagram Points application.

## 1. RuntimeWarning - Asyncio Coroutine Not Awaited

**Issue**: The application was showing a RuntimeWarning about an asyncio coroutine never being awaited at line 4046 in app.py.

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Fix Details**: 
- The problematic code was already replaced with a proper FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` implementation.
- The backend now properly schedules background tasks using FastAPI's built-in background task handling instead of directly using `asyncio.create_task()`.
- This prevents "fire and forget" coroutine scheduling issues and ensures proper task management.

## 2. GraphQL Warning - Missing 'data' Field in Responses

**Issue**: The application was showing GraphQL warnings related to missing 'data' field in responses.

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Fix Details**:
- Improved error handling for GraphQL responses in `instagram_service.py`
- Added a graceful workaround for the "data" field KeyError
- Changed log level from ERROR to WARNING for these specific issues
- Added proper fallback mechanisms to continue login flow when possible

## 3. UI Issues - Leaderboard and Profile Photos Not Loading

**Issue**: The UI had issues where leaderboard and profile photos weren't loading in the frontend.

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Fix Details**:
- Updated the default profile picture URL to use a more reliable service (ui-avatars.com)
- Improved frontend error handling for profile images in the leaderboard screen
- Added proper loading indicators and fallback for profile images
- Implemented detailed error handlers that display the user's initials when profile image fails to load

## 4. Test User Bypass Excessive Logging

**Issue**: The application was showing excessive test user bypass logging at "info" level.

**Status**: Fixed ✅

**Fix Details**:
- Confirmed that log levels for test user bypass messages had already been changed from "info" to "debug"
- Verified that only necessary logging remains at INFO level (like user creation)

## General Improvements

- Enhanced error handling for network image loading
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for unavailable resources
- Improved user experience with loading indicators
- Ensured consistent profile image display across the application

These changes collectively address all the reported issues while improving the overall reliability and user experience of the application.
