# Enhanced Badge System Integration - Deployment Guide

## 🎖️ Overview
The Instagram points platform now includes a comprehensive enhanced badge system that automatically awards badges to users based on their activities, achievements, and milestones.

## ✅ Integration Completed

### 2. **New API Endpoints**
The following endpoints have been added to the main application:

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Badge System
Run the initialization script to set up all badge definitions:

```bash
cd backend
python init_badges.py

If you prefer to use the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/badges/initialize" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### Step 4: Test the System
